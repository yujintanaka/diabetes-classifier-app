# Diabetes Prediction App Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This app predicts the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on a 20 questions survey. It was built using Streamlit for the user interface and employs a simple Logistic Regression Classifier for predictions. The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive tool for seeing your risk profile.

---

## Features
- User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
- Real-time prediction based on user-provided data.
- Visual representation of your risk profile using TSNE
- Built on open-source data from Kaggle.

---

## Dataset
The dataset and survey comes from a simplified version of The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC.
The dataset used for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset), containing features such as:
- Age
- Blood Pressure
- BMI
- Smoker
- Physical Activity

### Target variable:
- **Outcome**: 0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic or pre-diabetic.

## Model Information
The machine learning model implemented in this app is a **Logistic Regression Classifier**, chosen because the model weights are small and can easily host for free, but in my experimentation the Decision Tree Classfier had the best performance.
- **Performance**: Achieved an accuracy of 75% and 91% using Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Both type 1 and type 2 errors occur at the same rate as the dataset was balanced using oversampling. From a medical ethics standpoint, it is better to have a higher rate of false positives than false negatives, so on a real production build I would make sure to use that one. You can try it for yourself if you un-comment the rfc lines.
